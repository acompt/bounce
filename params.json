{"name":"Bounce","tagline":"23 final project","body":"This is the final project for Comp23 Game Development.\r\nIt was developed for iOS using sprite kit on Xcode.\r\n\r\n# How to Play:\r\nThe player is given the option between two characters: Tigger from Winnie the Pooh and Elsa from Frozen*.\r\nThe character starts with an initial velocity and the player must tap the screen to change the velocity in order to collect points and avoid damages. \r\n\r\nTigger: Begin as Tigger and bound through fields collecting as many honey pots as possible to share with your friend Pooh. But be careful bees do not take kindly to stealing.\r\n\r\nElsa: Begin as Elsa and enjoy the snowy wonderland making (collecting) as many Olafs as possible. However, you must also watch out for frozen daggers that are not as soft as snow.\r\n\r\n## Lets Get Started: \r\nIn order to play you must have a working version of Xcode on your mac.\r\nDownload and unzip the file (or clone the directory).\r\nYou can then open the file in Xcode and run using the iOS simulator.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots:\r\n<img src=http://i.imgur.com/EpVTr1x.png>\r\n\r\n<img src=http://i.imgur.com/aHjsYPz.png>\r\n\r\n\r\n*I did not create these characters as they have been taken from A. A. Milne and Disney.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
